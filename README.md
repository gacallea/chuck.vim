# chuck.vim
chuck.vim syntax -- apparently I'm a [maintainer](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS#L361) now

## issues

if you find any issues with the syntax file (e.g: misclassification, missing items, etc), please open an issue with a brief description and rationale.

Thank you for your collaboration :)
